Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
In this project, I worked with transactional data from an online retail store to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 
The dataset contains detailed information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.
By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified patterns, outliers, and correlations within the data.
My analysis revealed key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. 
Using visualizations and statistical techniques, I provided actionable insights that can help drive strategic business decisions, optimize store operations, and improve customer satisfaction.
The goal of this project was to leverage data-driven recommendations to enhance the store's performance in the competitive online retail market.
